# AI-Wedding-Planning-Software
developing an innovative AI software tailored for wedding planning. Your role will involve data analysis, algorithm design, and machine learning model implementation to enhance our platform's functionalities. Ideal candidates should have experience in handling large datasets and a passion for creating user-friendly solutions.
-------------
To develop an innovative AI software tailored for wedding planning, we can break down the project into several key functionalities, such as:

    Guest List Management: Analyzing the guest list data to suggest possible seating arrangements, food preferences, and more.
    Budgeting: Optimizing the wedding budget based on preferences and requirements.
    Vendor Recommendations: Suggesting vendors like florists, photographers, etc., based on user preferences and budget.
    Event Timeline Planning: Suggesting and creating an optimized event timeline.
    AI Chatbot Assistance: A chatbot to assist the users in planning, answering queries, and providing recommendations.

We will use various techniques, such as data analysis, machine learning, and algorithm design, to implement these features.

Here's a Python code framework that starts by handling a simple Wedding Vendor Recommendation System using machine learning and data analysis.
1. Setting up the AI Software: Wedding Vendor Recommendations

For this system, we'll build a recommendation system that suggests wedding vendors based on user preferences (e.g., budget, style, location, etc.).
Step 1: Install the necessary libraries

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Step 2: Sample Code for Building the Wedding Vendor Recommendation System

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Sample data: Vendor preferences (Budget, Style, Location, Rating)
data = {
    'Vendor Name': ['Florist A', 'Florist B', 'Photographer A', 'Photographer B', 'DJ A', 'DJ B', 'Caterer A', 'Caterer B'],
    'Type': ['Florist', 'Florist', 'Photographer', 'Photographer', 'DJ', 'DJ', 'Caterer', 'Caterer'],
    'Budget': [200, 150, 1000, 1200, 800, 600, 1500, 1300],
    'Style': [2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 2, 4, 3],  # Scale: 1 (Traditional) to 5 (Modern)
    'Location': [3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1],  # Scale: 1 (Local) to 5 (International)
    'Rating': [4.5, 4.2, 5.0, 4.7, 4.3, 4.8, 4.9, 4.6]
}

# Create a DataFrame
df_vendors = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Features to recommend vendors: Budget, Style, Location, Rating
X = df_vendors[['Budget', 'Style', 'Location', 'Rating']]

# Fit Nearest Neighbors model
model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=3)
model.fit(X)

# Function to get recommendations based on user input (e.g., Budget, Style, Location)
def get_vendor_recommendations(user_preferences):
    # Reshape user preferences to match the input format
    user_input = np.array(user_preferences).reshape(1, -1)
    
    # Find the nearest neighbors (vendors) based on the input preferences
    distances, indices = model.kneighbors(user_input)
    
    # Return recommended vendors and their details
    recommended_vendors = df_vendors.iloc[indices[0]]
    return recommended_vendors

# Example: User preferences - Budget: 1000, Style: 4 (Modern), Location: 3 (National), Rating: 4.5
user_preferences = [1000, 4, 3, 4.5]
recommended_vendors = get_vendor_recommendations(user_preferences)

print("Recommended Wedding Vendors:")
print(recommended_vendors[['Vendor Name', 'Type', 'Budget', 'Style', 'Location', 'Rating']])

# Visualizing vendor ratings and types
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.barplot(x='Vendor Name', y='Rating', data=df_vendors, hue='Type')
plt.title('Wedding Vendor Ratings')
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Explanation of Code:

    Data Representation: We define a small sample dataset (data) of wedding vendors, including attributes like Budget, Style, Location, and Rating.
    Feature Selection: These attributes are used to train a recommendation system using the Nearest Neighbors algorithm. This is an unsupervised learning method to suggest vendors similar to the user's preferences.
    Vendor Recommendation: We create a function get_vendor_recommendations that takes user preferences (e.g., budget, style) and uses the trained model to suggest the nearest vendors based on similarity.
    Visualization: We use a bar plot to visualize vendor ratings and types to help with analysis.

2. Expanding the System for Full Wedding Planning
A. Wedding Guest List Management:

The system can also help manage wedding guest lists, including RSVP tracking, seating arrangements, and meal preferences. This can be expanded with machine learning techniques like clustering for seating arrangement optimizations.
B. Vendor Booking System:

Once the user selects the vendors, you can integrate an AI-driven calendar and scheduling system to automatically book appointments with vendors based on availability.
C. AI-Chatbot Integration:

An AI-powered chatbot (like Dialogflow or GPT-3) can be used to assist users with recommendations, updates, and reminders regarding their wedding.

Example of integrating an AI-based chatbot:

import openai

# Set OpenAI API Key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

def ask_wedding_chatbot(question):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"Wedding planning chatbot. Answer the question: {question}",
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example question
question = "Can you suggest a good wedding photographer?"
answer = ask_wedding_chatbot(question)
print(f"Chatbot response: {answer}")

D. Budget Management with AI:

Using AI, the budget can be optimized by adjusting costs across vendors based on user preferences, predicting possible overruns, and suggesting alternative cost-effective options.
E. Wedding Timeline Planning:

AI can automate the creation of a wedding event timeline based on user preferences (e.g., ceremony time, reception, vendor services).
Conclusion:

This Wedding Planning AI Software can evolve to offer various functionalities that assist couples in managing their wedding planning process efficiently. By leveraging machine learning algorithms for vendor recommendations, budgeting, and timeline planning, the software can provide a personalized experience, while integration with AI-powered chatbots and scheduling systems further enhances the platform's usability.

To scale this solution for a large number of users, you could host the software as a web application using frameworks like Flask or Django, integrate it with cloud-based solutions, and deploy it for real-time user interactions.
